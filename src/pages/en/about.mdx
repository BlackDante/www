## About us

We are one of the oldest .NET meetups in Poland. Our beginnings date back to March 2016, when the group's first meetings took place at the Microsoft Poland office.

Our group is a safe space where people taking their first steps in the field of public speaking, can take their first steps. We are also proud to host experienced speakers, recognized throughout the country and around the world.

Our goal is to provide our community with a platform for: meetings, networking, exchange of knowledge and ideas.

Since 2014, we have been supported by the Warsaw branch of [7N](https://www.7n.com/), without which many things would not be possible.
